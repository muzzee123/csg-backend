CSG students assessment back end:

Technologies:
I used spring to develop the back end service for this application.
I restful services to expose the api service.
I used an in memory H2 database.

Building the application:
1. download the project to your local machine
2. go to the root of the project
3. run mvn clean install
4.mvn spring-boot:run
5. the application can be accessed on http://localhost:8080, http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html or via the frontend provided.

Note:
I have added a default script to add students to the db
